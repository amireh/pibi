<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
  Your <a href="<%= AppURL %>"><%= AppName %></a>&trade; account registered to this
  email address has a temporary password generated automatically by the server.
</p>

<p>You will be requested to change this password before proceeding. The temporary password is:</p>

<p><code><%= @n.data %></code></p>

<p>You can change your password by logging in to <a href="<%= AppURL %>"><%= AppName %></a>&trade;
  as you will be automatically redirected to the password changing form, or by visiting <a href="<%= "#{__host}#{@n.url}" %>">this</a> link.
</p>

<p>If you are not "<%= current_user.name %>" or didn't sign up for this account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
